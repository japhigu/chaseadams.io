title: My 15 Essential Reads For Professional Growth in 2014
slug: 2014/01/reading-list
---

I'm reading 15 books in 2014 to ramp up my personal and professional growth. The list has been curated with one question in mind: Will this book support one of my personal cannonballs?

## How I Decided What to Read in 2014

I started by forming cannonballs for 2014 and I wanted my reading to support these six:

- Architect Better Habits
- Sticky Ideas (Anatomy &amp; Execution)
- Learning, Education &amp; Creativity
- Build A Platform
- Express Myself Clearly
- Choices (How They Work &amp; How to Make them Better)

With these cannonballs as my framework, I took the list of approximately 300 books in my Amazon Wishlists, in my Evernote and on my bookshelf and narrowed my potential list to around 20 books. From that list I went through each book’s summary and wrote an ‘I want to...’ statement — a statement of what I want to take away from the book. I picked 15 books from that list, that had the “I want to…” statements and that most impacted my cannonballs.

## The Books That Made The Cut

### [The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/1400069289)

<strong>Big Idea:</strong> At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren’t destiny.

  <p>
    <strong>Why I Want to Read It:</strong> I want to understand my habits so I can modify them to either fortify a cannonball or minimize wasted time.
  </p>

  <p class="marker">
    <strong>Update:</strong> I finished it and wrote a [review on the Power of Habit](http://www.realchaseadams.com/2014/01/24/book-review-the-power-of-habit-why-we-do-what-we-do-in-life-and-business/) in January. It was a really insightful read! (01/24/2014)
