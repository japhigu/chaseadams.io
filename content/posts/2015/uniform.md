It was 4:30 AM. I knew I had goals for the morning, but I thought to myself, "checking my work email won't hurt. Surely no one's emailed me between 9 PM last night and this morning." The next thing I knew it was 6:30 AM and I'd spent most of my morning reactively responding to work emails.

_Work_ emails.

That morning I knew it was time to declare a separation of work and life...but I had no idea where to even start.

Fortunately, my buddy Thai, a guy who I've looked to for honing my personal operational rigor, had been dealing with the same problem and that same morning we sat and had coffee on the bistro

## Create A Work Uniform

The first step to creating the separation between work and life was creating a uniform. It didn't have to be a "true" uniform just a token that represented that I was "on", I was at work.

This turned out to be pretty simple. I found a [silicone wristband](https://www.reminderband.com/) that I keep in the car and as soon as I get to my parking spot at work, I shoot Jackie a text to let her know I'm in the office and done my silicone wristband. I try to take it off as soon as I get back to my car and at the latest when I get to my driveway.

Interestingly, I forgot to take it off one day and I was "tempted" to check my email...and only then did I realize I still had it on!

## Create A Work Routine

When I get into the office, I have a routine that involves taking the stairs to the second floor to grab a cup of coffee and two bottles of perrier, taking the stairs to the 10th floor and writing documentation or working on an internal project and finally making my way back to the 5th floor for standup.

I try really hard not to check my email before standup, so that I can be proactive about the first hour of my day.

At the end of the day, I make some notes about how I spent my day in and how I could have spent it better in DayOne, shut down all the applications on my work laptop and shut my computer off. I don't turn it on until the next morning when I start my routine over again.

## Timeblocks & Tasklists

I have a set amount of time that I'm willing work, with buffers on both start and finish and a _reasonable_ list of things I know I need to get done that day. Blocking your time and having a hard limit to how long you'll stay at the office is probably the most important component of all. Being able to create limits is a difficult discipline, but it's one worth doing.

Do I stay late sometimes? Absolutely. Last week I had to stay well past my normal hard limit four nights a week, but I knew it was coming because of the gravity of the project I was working on. I let Jackie know at the beginning of the week that I was going to be late getting home every night and she was totally fine with it. I'd like to think that it's because I've been better about guarding my time lately.

One last thought on hard limits and breaking them: If you stick to your hard limits, when you do break them, make it count. Choose to stay late for _good_ reasons.

## Liberate Your Life From Work

If you've been in the workforce for any period of time, I don't think I need to tell you how hard it can be to separate work and life.

If you haven't burnt out already but you're working non-stop, I imagine burn out is close. You don't have to work all the time to be a machine of productivity.

You might be thinking to yourself, "this guy is an idiot, he has no idea what he's talking about." I, myself, have been there. That's okay. I think there are seasons when we just go full-throttle and we can handle burning the candle at both ends. But I'd like to encourage you, that when you do hit your wall, that you come back and revisit these keys for work-life balance.
