Hi there! My name is Chase Adams and I'm a web developer at Zappos.com, a life hacker and advocate for alternative methods for learning.

My goal for chaseadams.io is to help other people discover the *tools*, *resources* and *inner-strengths* necessary to help them **find their dream job, their passion and the hidden free time** they always wanted. In order to satisfy this goal, I write about personal growth, life hacking & web technologies. I also write reviews on books, software, hardware and other cool products.

I typically post twice a week, but it's rare that I won't read something I want to respond to immediately or finish a product I'm working on and want to put it out.

## My Biography

[<img src="http://www.realchaseadams.com/imgs/2014/01/me_and_tag-300x300.jpg" alt="me_and_tag-300x300" width="250" height="250" class="align-left size-full wp-image-171" />][7] **My faith is the foundation to the rest of my life and the lens that I view the world through.** I believe in God the Father & Jesus the Son, in Grace & Love and in always striving to be the best version of me that I can be, not because it's required but because I'm free to pursue it.

**My family is my greatest earthly joy: my beautiful wife Jackie and our ragamuffin puppy**. I met Jackie over a fetal pig in a biology lab that I wasn't even in, and we've been geeking out about science and life ever since.

Tag came to us from [Happy Homes Animal Sanctuary][8] when he was 3 months old and he has given us quite the adventure. He loves to run in circles at full speed at the dog park, solve puppy puzzles and cuddle and nap with his pet Alligator.

I'm a mobile web/front end developer at [Zappos.com][9]. One of my favorite aspects of being a developer is partaking in discovering and building features that will wow our customers. My favorite quality about Zappos is that you're empowered to get involved in other things that you get excited about, so I also pursue other roles: educator, collision curator and mentor.

Some of the languages I love to write are HTML, CSS, Javascript (front end and back end), Ruby and Markdown. If you want to get started in web development, I recommend trying the [Hour of Code Angry Birds tutorial][10]. This is a great starting point for understanding what it actually means to be a programmer. It may feel basic at first, but the whole point is to get you excited about programming as a concept.

In my free time, I enjoy [reading books on personal and professional development][11], writing and generating ideas that I can implement myself. When weather permits, I love to go hiking with Jackie and Tag, hack at coffee shops, hanging out at the dog park and play four square.

I geek out over cool, innovative products.

I enjoy attempting to solve riddles and puzzles.

I love life.
